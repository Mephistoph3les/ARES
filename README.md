This project covers the data analysis of the electron CT multiple scattering validation data that was taken from 02.04.24 to 05.04.24 at ARES

The main goal of that measurement was to get a good calibration plot of multiple scattering material reconstruction.
For this it was vital to look at high statistics of multiple scattering in different known materials.
With fine calibration the scattering width can be used to get information about the material that caused the scattering.
The calibration seems to be independent of the material and describes the beam broadening depending on the material budget.

/underline{1. Step:}
Burj is a pyramid shaped block of PEEK (Polyether ether ketone) with very well defined steps of widths which increase in 5mm steps.
This material block was placed in an electron pencil beam of 154.5 MeV energy.
A moving stage was able to move the material in such a way that we were able to measure the scattering width of this electron beam for the different thickness steps of Burj.
Measuring time was 5 minutes for each thickness in a separate data file.

/underline{2. Step:}
Metal sheets of aluminium and nickel in different thicknesses were put on a holding mechanism to be moved by a stage to have the electron beam penetrate the sheets and their overlap regions.
A lot of statistics went into this measurement with an overnight scan of nickel sheets and a 1 hour scan of aluminium.
This scan data is saved in two single data files where a separation of data is needed to distinguish between the different metal plate thicknesses.
This separation is done by looking at the corresponding timestamps in the logfile of the ARES moving stage.
One have to take into account not only the 5 minutes measuring time per stage position but also the moving time of the stage to the next position which CAN vary.
